<-----About The Project----->

I have to create a sign up form which validates the user's inputs and show a message that the user has been succesfully signed up & if not give a message

<-----My Thought Process----->

According to the design the odin project gave me, I have to create a classic sign-up form where in the left side there is a solid color as a background with a logo in it and in the right side there
should be a form element with,
                            1. First name input
                            2. Last name input
                            3. Email input
                            4. Confirm email input
                            5. Password input
                            6. Confirm password input
                            7. A button that not only submits the data but act as trigger that the user is done signing up and tells the html to show the thank you page.
And last but not least under the form should be a a log-in button.
